          <p> My name is Maria Bean and I am currently a part-time student. I am attending the coding bootcamp through Washington University to become a full stack developer. Outside of work and school, I spend most of my time with my kids and husband. I also like to crochet, listen to audiobooks, hike, cuddle with my pets, and collect various house plants. Below, you will find links to my current deployed projects and contact information. Reach out to me with any questions! I look forward to hearing from you soon.  </p>
